\usage{

  residuals,

  plots = "default",
  bins = 30,
  smoother = FALSE,
  qqline = TRUE,
  qqbands = FALSE,
  scale = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{residuals}{The residuals from the model.}

\item{predicted}{The fitted values from the model.}

\item{plots}{Plots chosen to include in the panel of plots. The default panel
includes a residual plot, a normal quantile plot, an index plot,
and a histogram of the residuals. (See details for the options available.)}

\item{bins}{Number of bins for histogram of the residuals. Default is set to 30.}

\item{smoother}{Indicates whether or not to include a smoother on the
residual plot and/or index plot. Specify TRUE or FALSE. Default is set to FALSE.}

\item{qqline}{Indicates whether to include a 1-1 line on the qq-plot. Specify
TRUE or FALSE. Default is set to TRUE.}

\item{qqbands}{Indicates whether to include confidence bands on the qq-plot.
Specify TRUE or FALSE. Default is set to FALSE.}

\item{scale}{Scales the size of the graphs in a panel. Takes values in (0,1].}

\item{theme}{ggplot2 theme to be used. Options are \code{"bw"},
\code{"classic"}, and \code{"grey"} (or \code{"gray"}). Default is
\code{"bw"}.}

\item{axis.text.size}{Specifies the size of the text for the axis labels of
all plots.}

\item{title.text.size}{Specifies the size of the text for the titles of all
plots.}

\item{title.opt}{Indicates whether or not to include a title on the plots.
Specify TRUE or FALSE. Default is set to TRUE.}

\item{nrow}{Sets the number of rows in the panel.}

\item{alpha}{Sets the alpha level for displays with points. Default is set to 0.6.}
}
\value{
A panel of residual diagnostic plots containing plots specified.
}
\description{
Creates a panel of residual diagnostic plots given inputs of residuals and
fitted values.
}
\details{
The following grid options can be chosen for the \code{plots}
  argument.
  \itemize{
  \item "all": This creates a panel of all plot types included in the package
  that are available for \code{resid_auxpanel}. (See plot descriptions under
  individual options.)
  \item "default": This creates a panel with a residual plot, a normal quantile plot
  of the residuals, an index plot of the residuals, and a histogram of the residuals.
  \item "SAS": This creates a panel of a residual plot, a normal quantile plot of the
  residuals, a histogram of the residuals, and a boxplot of the residuals. This was
  modeled after the residpanel option in proc mixed from SAS version 9.4.
  \item A vector of individual plots can also be specified. For example, one
  can specify \code{plots = c("boxplot", "hist")} or \code{plots = "qq"}. The
  individual plot options are as follows.
  \itemize{
  \item \code{"boxplot"}: A boxplot of residuals
  \item \code{"hist"}: A histogram of residuals
  \item \code{"index"}: A plot of residuals versus observation number
  \item \code{"qq"}: A normal quantile plot of residuals
  \item \code{"resid"}: A plot of residuals versus predicted values
  } }

  Details on the creation of the plots can be found in the details section of
  the help file for \code{resid_panel}.

# Fit a regression tree to the penguins data

# Obtain the predictions from the model on the observed data
penguin_tree_pred <- predict(penguin_tree)

# Obtain the residuals from the model

# Create a panel with the residual and index plot

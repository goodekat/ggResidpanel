residual-leverage, location-scale, and residual plots. Specify TRUE or FALSE.
Default is set to FALSE.}

TRUE or FALSE. Default is set to TRUE.}

\code{"classic"}, and \code{"grey"} (or \code{"gray"}). Default is
\code{"bw"}.}

}
\value{
A panel of residual diagnostic plots containing plots specified.
}
\description{
Creates a panel of residual diagnostic plots given a model. Currently accepts
models of type "lm", "glm", "lmerMod", "lmerModLmerTest", "lme", and "glmerMod".
}
\details{
The first two sections below contain information on the available input
options for the \code{plots} and \code{type} arguments in \code{resid_panel}.
The third section contains details relating to the creation of the plots.

\strong{Options for Plots}

The following options can be chosen for the \code{plots} argument.
\itemize{
\item "all": This creates a panel of all plot types included in the package
that are available for the model type input into \code{resid_panel}. (See note
below.)
\item "default": This creates a panel with a residual plot, a normal quantile plot
of the residuals, an index plot of the residuals, and a histogram of the residuals.
\item "R": This creates a panel with a residual plot, a normal
quantile plot of the residuals, a location-scale plot, and a residuals versus leverage
plot. This was modeled after the plots shown in R if the \code{plot()} base function
is applied to an \code{lm} model. This option can only be used with an \code{lm} or
\code{glm} model.
\item "SAS": This creates a panel with a residual plot, a normal quantile plot of
the residuals, a histogram of the residuals, and a boxplot of the residuals.
This was modeled after the residualpanel option in proc mixed from SAS version 9.4.
\item A vector of individual plots can also be specified.
For example, one can specify \code{plots = c("boxplot", "hist")} or
\code{plots = "qq"}. The individual plot options are as follows.
\itemize{
\item \code{"boxplot"}: A boxplot of residuals
\item \code{"cookd"}: A plot of Cook's D values versus observation numbers
\item \code{"hist"}: A histogram of residuals
\item \code{"index"}: A plot of residuals versus observation numbers
\item \code{"ls"}: A location scale plot of the residuals
\item \code{"qq"}: A normal quantile plot of residuals
\item \code{"lev"}: A plot of standardized residuals versus leverage values
\item \code{"resid"}: A plot of residuals versus predicted values
\item \code{"yvp":}: A plot of observed response values versus predicted values
} }

Note: \code{"cookd"}, \code{"ls"}, and \code{"lev"} are only available for "lm" and
"glm" models.

\strong{Options for Type}

Several residual types are available to be requested based on the model type
that is input into \code{resid_panel}. These currently are as follows.
\itemize{
\item \code{lm} residual options
\itemize{
\item \code{"pearson"}:The Pearson residuals
\item \code{"response"}: The raw residuals (Default for "lm")
\item \code{"standardized"}: The standardized raw residuals
}
\item \code{glm} residual options
\itemize{
\item \code{"pearson"}: The Pearson residuals
\item \code{"deviance"}: The deviance residuals (Default for "glm")
\item \code{"response"}: The raw residuals
\item \code{"stand.deviance"}: The standardized deviance residuals
\item \code{"stand.pearson"}: The standardized Pearson residuals
}
\item \code{lmer}, \code{lmerTest}, and \code{lme} residual options
\itemize{
\item \code{"pearson"}: The Pearson residuals (Default for "lmer", "lmerTest", and "lme")
\item \code{"response"}: The raw residuals
}
\item \code{glmer} residual options
\itemize{
\item \code{"pearson"}: The Pearson residuals
\item \code{"deviance"}: The deviance residuals (Default for "glmer")
\item \code{"response"}: The raw residuals
} }

Note: The plots of \code{"ls"} and \code{"lev"} only accept standardized residuals.

\strong{Details on the Creation of Plots}

\describe{
\item{Boxplot (\code{boxplot})}{Boxplot of the residuals.}

\item{Cook's D (\code{cookd})}{ The horizontal line represents a cut-off to identify
highly influential points. The horizontal line is placed at 4/n where n is
the number of data points used in the \code{model}.}

\item{Histogram (\code{hist})}{Plots a histogram of the residuals. The density
curve overlaid has mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to the
standard deviation of the residuals.}

\item{Index Plot (\code{index})}{Plots the residuals on the y-axis and the observation
number associated with the residual on the x-axis.}

\item{Residual-Leverage Plot (\code{lev})}{Plots the standardized residuals on the
y-axis and the leverage values on the x-axis with a loess curve is overlaid. Cook's
D contour lines (which are a function of leverage and standardized residuals) are plotted
as the red dashed lines for Cook's D values of 0.5 and 1.}

\item{Location-Scale Plot (\code{ls})}{Plots the square root of the absolute value
of the standardized residuals on the y-axis and the predicted values on the
x-axis. The predicted values are plotted on the original scale for \code{glm}
and \code{glmer} models. A loess curve is overlaid.}

\item{QQ Plot (\code{qq})}{Makes use of the \code{R} package \code{qqplotr} for
creating a normal quantile plot of the residuals.}

\item{Residual Plot (\code{resid})}{Plots the residuals on the y-axis and the
predicted values on the x-axis. The predicted values are plotted on the
original scale for \code{glm} and \code{glmer} models.}

\item{Response vs. Predicted (\code{yvp})}{Plots the response variable from the
model on the y-axis and the predicted values on the x-axis. Both response
variable and predicted values are plotted on the original scale for
\code{glm} and \code{glmer} models.}

\usage{
resid_interact(
  model,
  plots = "default",
  type = NA,
  bins = 30,
  smoother = TRUE,
  qqline = TRUE,
  scale = 0.9,
  theme = "bw",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model fit using either \code{lm}, \code{glm}, \code{lmer},
\code{lmerTest}, \code{lme}, or \code{glmer}.}

\item{plots}{Plots chosen to include in the panel of plots. The default panel
includes a residual plot, a normal quantile plot, an index plot,
and a histogram of the residuals. (See details in the help file
for \code{resid_panel} for the options available.)}

\item{type}{Type of residuals to use in the plot. If not specified, the
default residual type for each model type is used. (See details in the help file
for \code{resid_panel} for the options available.)}

\item{bins}{Number of bins to use when creating a histogram of the residuals.
Default is set to 30.}

\item{smoother}{Indicates whether or not to include a smoother on the residual 
vs fitted and index plots. Specify TRUE or FALSE. Default is set to TRUE.}

\item{qqline}{Indicates whether to include a 1-1 line on the qq-plot. Specify
TRUE or FALSE. Default is set to TRUE. (The option of \code{qqbands} has not
been implemented in plotly, so it is not available as an option with
\code{resid_interact}.)}

\item{scale}{Scales the size of the graphs in the panel. Takes values in (0,1].}

\item{theme}{ggplot2 theme to be used. Current options are \code{"bw"},
\code{"classic"}, and \code{"grey"} (or \code{"gray"}). Default is
\code{"bw"}.}

\item{axis.text.size}{Specifies the size of the text for the axis labels of
all plots in the panel.}

\item{title.text.size}{Specifies the size of the text for the titles of all
plots in the panel.}

\item{title.opt}{Indicates whether or not to include a title on the plots in
the panel. Specify TRUE or FALSE. Default is set to TRUE.}

\item{nrow}{Sets the number of rows in the panel.}

\item{alpha}{Sets the alpha level for displays with points. Default is set to 0.6.}
}
\value{
A panel of interactive residual diagnostic plots containing plots specified.
}
\description{
Creates a panel of interactive residual diagnostic plots given a model. Currently
accepts models of type "lm", "glm", "lmerMod", "lmerModLmerTest", "lme", and "glmerMod".
}
\details{
Details on the creation of the plots can be found in the details section of
  the help file for \code{resid_panel}.

\examples{

# Fit a model to the penguin data
penguin_model <- lme4::lmer(heartrate ~ depth + duration + (1|bird), data = penguins)

# Create the default interactive panel
resid_interact(penguin_model)

# Select only the residual plot and qq-plot to be included in the panel,
# set the number of rows to 2, change the theme to classic
resid_interact(penguin_model, plots = c("resid", "qq"), nrow = 2, theme = "classic")
}
